Module Challenge 9
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), a first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are in six CSV files that can be found in EmployeeSQL folder.

For this project, I have designed an ERD and created the tables to hold the data from the CSV files in pgadmin, later in imported the CSV files into a database, and then answered the questions about the data in another query terminal called "Analysis.sql". In this assignment I performed data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
